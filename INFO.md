# Easee EV charger component for Home Assistant

Custom component to support Easee EV chargers.

The status sensor is the default sensor and has the following values

```
STANDBY
PAUSED
CHARGING
READY_TO_CHARGE
CAR_CONNECTED
```

**_Important_**
This component quite new and uses the (easee library)[https://github.com/fondberg/pyeasee].
Please help me test and preferbly suggest the fixes as a PR or technical note in an issue.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through in Configuration > Integrations where you first configure it and then set the options for what you want to monitor.
